<h1> About me </h1>
I'm a Undergraduate Student studying in 2nd semester at the International University of Business Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT).
I'm exploring all the career aspects that are possible from CSE while maintaining a decent CGPA. 
I want to build a legacy and proof that you can shine even from a Private University that doesn't cost a fortune.
Currently I'm focusing on growing my linkedin account, getting my passport and correcting my HSC Certificate.
